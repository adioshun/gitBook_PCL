# [How to use iterative closest point](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/iterative_closest_point.php#iterative-closest-point)


This document demonstrates using the Iterative Closest Point algorithm in your code which can determine if one PointCloud is just a rigid transformation of another by minimizing the distances between the points of two pointclouds and rigidly transforming them.

The code
