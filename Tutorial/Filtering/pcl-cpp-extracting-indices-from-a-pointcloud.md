# [Extracting indices from a PointCloud](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/extract_indices.php)

In this tutorial we will learn how to use an :pcl:`ExtractIndices <pcl::ExtractIndices>` filter to extract a subset of points from a point cloud based on the indices output by a segmentation algorithm.

In order to not complicate the tutorial, the segmentation algorithm is not explained here. Please check the Plane model segmentation tutorial for more information.
