You can access most of pyntcloud's functionality from its core class: PyntCloud.

With PyntCloud you can perform complex 3D processing operations with minimum lines of code. For example you can:

Load a point cloud from disk.
Add 3 new scalar fields by converting RGB to HSV.
Build a grid of voxels from the point cloud.
Build a new point cloud keeping only the nearest point to each occupied voxel center.
Save the new point cloud.
