# Hough transform

> 

The Hough transform is a feature extraction technique

The Hough transform in its simplest form is a method to detect straight lines but it can also be used to detect circles or ellipses(타원)


Hough transform can also be used for the detection of 3D objects in range data or 3D point clouds
